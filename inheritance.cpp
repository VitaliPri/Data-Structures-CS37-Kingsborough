/*
 * Encapsulation we group data (functions, variables) related to one thing into object. like you group everything related to car
 *
 * Abstraction you only pay attention to main parts like you only press button to start a car you do not need to know all that goes behind.
 *
 * Inheritance we create block of code and reuse for other blocks aka create a class with fuctions that others can reuse in the application.
 *
 * Polymorphism is taking that instance (block of code) created in inheritance and override with own neecisity
 *
 * Polymorphism allows us to build application that can be easily extended.
